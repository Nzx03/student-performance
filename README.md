## Student-perfomance
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline** designed to predict a studentâ€™s **Math score** based on demographic and academic factors such as:  
- Gender  
- Race/Ethnicity  
- Parental level of education  
- Lunch type  
- Test preparation course  
- Reading and writing scores  

The project integrates:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **model training** using Jupyter Notebooks.  
- **Data pipeline** for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference.  
- **Flask-based web application** for real-time predictions.  
- **Artifacts storage** for datasets, trained models, preprocessing objects, and evaluation metrics.
